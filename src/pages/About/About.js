              We strive to provide world-class business and technology services

            <h6 style={captionStyle} align="center">
              We would like to acknowledge the fact that the land on which we
              gather, and operate our business, is part of the Treaty Lands and
              Territory of the Mississaugas of the Credit. For thousands of
              years, Indigenous peoples inhabited and cared for this land. In
              particular we acknowledge the territory of the Anishinabek,
              Huron-Wendat, Haudenosaunee and Ojibway/Chippewa peoples; the land
              that is home to the Metis; and most recently, the territory of the
              Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation who are direct descendants
              of the Mississaugas of the Credit. We are grateful to have the
              opportunity to work on this land, and by doing so, give our
              respect to its first inhabitants
              <br></br>
              <br></br>
              We would like to acknowledge the African Diaspora, its elders,
              their descendants and the lands upon which they live. For
              thousands of years African Indigenous peoples inhabited and cared
              for the land with a spiritual and cultural connection to the
              earth. In particular we acknowledge the continuing efforts to
              reconnect and reclaim African Indigenous ways of being and doing.
              We are grateful for the opportunity and responsibility to embrace
              our heritage, and by doing so, give our respect to the ancestors.
